This library eases the use of the JIRA REST API from Python and it has been used in production for years.

As this is an open-source project that is community maintained, do not be surprised if some bugs or features are not implemented quickly enough. You are always welcomed to use BountySource_ to motivate others to help.

Quickstart
----------

Feeling impatient? I like your style.

.. code-block:: python

        from jira import JIRA

        jira = JIRA('https://jira.atlassian.com')

        issue = jira.issue('JRA-9')
        print issue.fields.project.key             # 'JRA'
        print issue.fields.issuetype.name          # 'New Feature'
        print issue.fields.reporter.displayName    # 'Mike Cannon-Brookes [Atlassian]'


Installation
------------

Download and install using ``pip install jira`` or ``easy_install jira``

You can also try ``pip install --user --upgrade jira`` which will install or
upgrade jira to your user directory. Or maybe you ARE using a virtualenv_
right?

By default only the basic library dependencies are installed, so if you want
to use the ``cli`` tool or other optional dependencies do perform a full
installation using ``pip install jira[opt,cli,testing]``

.. _virtualenv: http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/index.html


Usage
-----

See the documentation_ for full details.

.. _documentation: http://jira.readthedocs.org/en/latest/


Development
-----------

Development takes place on GitHub_:

* ``master`` - (default branch) contains the primary development stream. Tags will be used to show latest releases.

.. _GitHub: https://github.com/pycontribs/jira

Setup
=====
* Fork_ repo
* Keep it sync_'ed while you are developing
* Install pyenv_
* Install Atlassian Server for testing
  - make install-sdk
* pip install requirements-dev.txt
* Start up Jira Server
  - atlas-run-standalone
* Test your changes
  - make test
